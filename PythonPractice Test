1)
passes string to function
the string is comprised of floats, separated by commas

Ex.
  str = '12.3,12.1...'
Goal
  ['12.3', '12.1']
  
  2)
    Average = Sum of All Numbers / the amountof numbers
    
   3)
    Getting up to a certain number counting backwards
    
    example
    list = [1 2 3 4 5]
    list[-num:]
    
   4) important concept of creating a empty list and appending
   
   5) creating a tuple, can you append to a tuple? cannot change the tuple:w
   
   
   Practice Test 1)
   1. 


make list
every three break into list
append a comma to the end
join

numlist = list(str(n)) list of the individual numbers
commas needed = len(list(str(n))) / 3 -> makes num to string, then to list, then gets length, divides by 3, finds how many commas are needed


*1 and *2
-3:-1


for item in numbrokenup:
        if
            newlist.append(item)
            newlist.append(item)
        elif
           newlist.append(item)
        counter += 1
        
        
 12     print(sentence)
 13     lenofsent = len(sentence.split())
 14     print(lenofsent)
 15     finallist = []
 16     for item in range(1,lenofsent+1):
 17         newlist = (sentence.split())[-item]
 18         finallist.append(newlist)
 19         print(finallist)
 20     return ' '.join(finallist)
